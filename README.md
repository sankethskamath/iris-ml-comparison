# Iris ML Comparison

**Goal:** Train and compare a variety of machine‑learning models on the Iris dataset, analyze results, and build a reproducible pipeline.

## Structure

- `data/` — raw & processed data  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter analyses  
- `src/` — reusable modules  
- `models/` — saved trained models  
- `results/` — metrics, plots, and reports  

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
2. Create a virtual environment  
3. Install requirements  
4. Run notebooks or scripts
